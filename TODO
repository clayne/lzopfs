- Write README
- Signals
	- Quit ASAP on SIGINT
	- Handle on main thread only
- Checksum blocks on decompression?
- Allow use of only some compression methods (autoconf)

- Optimizations
	- Single I/O thread
	- Don't cache uncompressed blocks
	- Don't decompress a block if it's already inflight
	- Speculative readahead
	- Don't lzma_end if unnecessary, for memory use?
	- Lock-free queue for thread-pool?

- Memory usage
	- Don't read whole index into memory. Use B-trees or something?
	- If we do read the whole index, don't keep the dict blocks in memory
	- Write the index as we go

- Way out there: Hierarchy based on tpxz files?
