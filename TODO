- Write README
- Add support for other compression formats (bzip2 + pbzip2)
- Remove debug messages
- Multi-threaded
	- Decompression threads
	- Multiple in-flight requests?
- Checksum blocks on decompression?
- Test on multi-stream files
	- pixz doesn't read its own streamed files :(  xz is ok though
	- gz: we only see the first stream
	- xz: block decode error (also, check padding? multi-check...)

- Way out there: Hierarchy based on tpxz files?
